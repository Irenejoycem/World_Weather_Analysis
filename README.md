# World_Weather_Analysis

# Purpose

The purpose for this is to use JSON and utilizing API calls in order to develop a travel app that compares weathers from various cities to determine where would be the best places to travel to.

# Results

In the Weather_Database folder, I was able to find a random set of latitude and longitudes and then doing API calls from the open weather map to find the current weather.

In the Vacation_search folder, based on the data found in Weather_Database, I was able to use the same latitude and longitudes to map it on a world map pulled fromm calling in API using JSON with google maps.

Finally, in the Vacation_Itinerary I was able to find a destination in Brazil that had a weather climate that I was interested in and by refactoring code, I created a vacation itinerary route between 4 locations.
